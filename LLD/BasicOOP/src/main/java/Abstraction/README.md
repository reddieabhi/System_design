# Abstraction

- Abstraction is concept of hiding the implementation and giving necessary functions to the user. 
So we get to know what an object does but not how it does

- Abstraction is a achieved by using abstract classes and in java it can be achieved from interfaces also.


## Features of Abstraction

1. Hiding implementation 
2. Abstract methods. (Any class implementing or extending abstract methods must have the methods defined in Abstract class)


## Benefits
1. Simplifies the code by hiding the implementation
2. Decreases direct dependency on class (We can see this in Dependency Inversion (SOLID))


## Methods to achieve 
1. Abstract classes
2. Interfaces (Java)
