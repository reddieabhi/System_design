# Design Patterns

- Design Patterns are standard solutions to common software design problems.
- Design patterns follow **SOLID principles** and are used in production systems.


## Types of Design Patterns
There are multiple design patterns that can be used to make our code structured.
Design Patterns are broadly categorized into 3 types, 
1. **Creation Design Patterns**
2. **Structural Design Patterns**
3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**

Here we are learning only few important design patterns mostly used by me in my daily coding. They are
## 1. Creation Design Patterns
Creational design patterns deal about object creation and usage efficiently. They abstract the implementations and make it more user-friendly. Below are few import creational design patterns 
   1. **Singleton** (In this pattern object of any class to be initialized only once and used for entire project. Ex : DB connection, logger etc) [Singleton](./src/main/java/Creational/Singleton/README.md)
   2. **Builder** (Used when a class has many optional or mandatory attributes. A separate builder class helps constructing the object with mandatory and optional fields ) [Builder](./src/main/java/Creational/Builder/README.md)
   3. **Factory** (Provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to decide which class to be used. ) [Factory](./src/main/java/Creational/Factory/README.md)
   4. **Abstract Factory** (A factory of factory. Used when there is a selection of Factory from available factories and class from the selected factory )
   5. **Prototype** (Object creation is computational expensive, then we clone a base object for that class and change the required fields.) [Prototype](./src/main/java/Creational/Prototype/README.md)
## 2. Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns aim in using classes with complexity, when multiple classes are being used we follow a structural format to keep the code clean and extensible. Here are few important structural design patterns.
   1. **Adapter Design Pattern** 
   2. **Bridge Design Pattern** 
## 3. Behavioral Design Patterns


I have created Separate packages in src/main/java for each design with easy understandable examples. To know more about design patterns you can navigate to that
