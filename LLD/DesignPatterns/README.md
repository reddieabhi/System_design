# Design Patterns

- Design Patterns are standard solutions to common software design problems.
- Design patterns follow **SOLID principles** and are used in production systems.


## Types of Design Patterns
There are multiple design patterns that can be used to make our code structured.
Design Patterns are broadly categorized into 3 types, 
1. **Creation Design Patterns**
2. **Structural Design Patterns**
3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**

Here we are learning only few important design patterns mostly used by me in my daily coding. They are
## 1. Creation Design Patterns
   1. **Singleton** (In this pattern object of any class to be initialized only once. Ex : DB connection, logger etc)
   2. **Builder** (Here we use a helper class for building the main class, when there are too many attributes and there are few mandatory attributes constrains )
   3. **Factory**
   4. **Abstract Factory**
   5. **Prototype**
## 2. Structural Design Patterns
## 3. Behavioral Design Patterns


I have created Separate packages in src/main/java for each design with easy understandable examples. To know more about design patterns you can navigate to that
